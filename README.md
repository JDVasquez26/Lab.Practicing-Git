This is a repo for learning git.

THis is a change I made so I can practice adding new changes. 

For the previous change I used git push and pushed previous changes,
but what is the difference between "git push" vs "git push origin main"?

During this change I will attempt to push with "git push origin main" and see what happens, would it still push or would it give me an error?
